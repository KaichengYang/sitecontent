# Basic Info

My name is Kaicheng Yang (杨凯程), you can also call me Kevin.

Current I'm working with [Prof. Zhixi Wu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=h8rHauQAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) as a Master student in physics at [Lanzhou University](http://www.lzu.edu.cn/), China.
Before that I was trained as a theoretical physicist at [Lanzhou University](http://www.lzu.edu.cn/).
You can see my [CV](https://github.com/KaichengYang/mycv/raw/master/cv.pdf) for more information.

During the last 3 years, I have systematically learned about the epidemic process and evolutionary games on complex networks.
Recently, I have been focusing on the expansion process of population on networked landscapes.
I'm also involved in a project regarding the spreading of multi-component virus on networks.

I have been admitted by the School of Informatics and Computing's Ph.D program in Informatics with tracks in Complex Systems at Indiana University Bloomington.
After I graduate from Lanzhou University this July, I will fly to U.S.
